### About
I've made this boilerplate for my own purpose to fit most of my needs when it comes to building HTTP servers and APIs.
Many times I've noticed a lot of my code overlapped. Some parts I've improved since the previous projects. I've made so many
HTTP servers that I've decided to take everything from the latest one and put it into a neat boilerplate for future use
and improvements. Some things need polish, some need another rework, but what I've got here lets me build fast and safe 
applications in a supersonic pace. Even if the code might be confusing for some people out there.

_Why Rust?_ <br>
`It's fast and fun.`

_Why Hyper?_ <br>
`It's low level.`

_Why SurrealDB?_ <br>
`It's powerfull and easy.`
